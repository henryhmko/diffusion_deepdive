# Project Cerulean
### Exploration-based project aimed at understanding how diffusion models work by implementing various diffusion models.


## Approach:
  1. Single-Image Generation (to verify that diffusion does work)
  2. Single-Class Generation ([Landscape data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/landscape-pictures) from Kaggle)
  3. Multi-Class Conditional Generation (CIFAR 10)
  4. Latent Diffusion (CIFAR 10)

## Single-Image Generation
All Training done on 1 x RTX 2080
